        <h2>They're Amazing!</h2>
        <p>
        Tigers are the largest cat species in the world and third largest land carnivore, with Siberian Tigers,
        pictured above, weighing up to 660 pounds! They typically live to be about 10-15 years, but a few have been
        known to live up to 26 years. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Tigers' stripes are like human fingerprints - every tiger's are unique! They're also the only cat
            to be completely striped, meaning they have striped skin.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        You might be surprised to find out that tigers aren't great hunters. The estimate is that a tiger
        is successful only 1 in 10 or 20 attempts. They'll hunt any time of day but are best at night
        because of their strong night vision. While not great at hunting, they're fantastic swimmers. 
        They'll swim pretty far to hunt or cross rivers, and the cubs play in water too. They mostly 
        eat deer, boar, buffalo, and antelope. They aren't picky though!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Female tigers are also awesome mamas! They usually give birth to two or three blind cubs
        and raise and protect them for two years. After that, tigers are solitary for the most part.
